## Hydrogen 
Hydrogen is a NSQ Consumer/Producer living on the aarch64 hypervisor. It takes in jobs specifically related to libvirt vms on the hypervisor, listening on `aarch64-libvirt-[hostname]#main` for jobs. It also keeps track of local VM Power States and outputs those to `aarch64-power`. 
### Commonly found in
* `aarch64-libvirt-[hostname]#main`
### Known to harass
* `Helium`
### Flags
* `nsq-connect-uri`
* `domain-cache-path`

## Helium
Helium is an NSQ Consumer with the role of taking in VM Power State changes from hypervisors and updating the central mongodb server with the new state.

### Commonly found in
* `aarch64-power#helium`
### Known to harass
* Nobody, Helium is quite scared of others
### Flags
* `nsq-connect-uri`

## Beryllium
Beryllium is an NSQ Consumer residing on the hypervisors. It listens on `aarch64-proxy#[hostname]` and updates the local HAProxy configuration in accordance with the received messages.
